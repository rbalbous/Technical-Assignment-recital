Here is my submission for the Maze genrator and solver

To launch the maze generator :
`python3 mazeGenerator.py`

To launch the maze solver :
`python3 mazeSolver.py`
This opertaion will generate a random maze grid and solve it



I used breadth first search as my solving algorithm

The display is completely on the standard output

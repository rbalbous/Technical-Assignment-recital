Here is my submission for the Maze genrator and solver

To launch the maze generator :
`python3 mazeGenerator.py`

To launch the maze solver :
`python3 mazeSolver.py`
This operation will generate a random maze grid and solve it

All the parameters and display can be modified at the top of the files
